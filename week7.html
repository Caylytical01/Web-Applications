    <h2>Way to show each of the Love Languages (<a href=https://www.5lovelanguages.com/book/the-5-love-languages-of-children/>from the text</a>)</h2>
    
    <h3>Physical Touch</h3>
     
    <p>When you greet or say goodbye to your young child, 
    gather them into your arms and hold them. Kneel down for small children. Let your child hold or cuddle a soft item, 
     such as a blanket to soothe them.</p>
    
     <h3>Words of Affirmation</h3>
    
     <p>Put a <a href=https://www.post-it.com/3M/en_US/post-it/products/~/Post-it-Super-Sticky-Pop-up-Notes-3-in-x-3-in-Miami-collection-6-Pads-Pack-90-Sheets-Pad/?N=4327+3292177635+3294529207&preselect=5927575+8756798+3293786499&rt=rud>Post-it note</a> in their lunchbox with some encouraging words.
        Make a habit of mentioning something specific you’ve observed that highlights your child’s accomplishments. 
        Examples include: “I really appreciated how you showed kindness to that other child,” or “I liked the positive attitude you had during the game.” 
    
    <h3>Quality Time</h3>
    
    <p>Instead of waiting until all your chores are done before spending time with your child, include them in your daily activities such as laundry, grocery shopping, or yard work.
    
    <h3>Gifts</h3>
    
    <p>Keep a small collection of <a href=https://www.parenting.com/birthdays/gifts/inexpensive-gift-ideas-kids/>inexpensive gifts</a> packed away for your child. Then give them one at a time as you sense there is a need.
     Select presents that fit the interests of your child. 
    </p>
    
    <h3>Acts of Service</h3>

    <P>Help your child practice for their sports team, such as pitch and catch for baseball or shooting free throws for children participating in basketball. 
     Sit down and help your child if they’re having computer problems. 
      Instead of just telling your younger children to go to bed, pick them up and gently carry them and tuck them in their blankets. </P>
